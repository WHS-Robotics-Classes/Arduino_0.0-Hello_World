# Arduino 0.0-Hello World
This is our initial programming assignment for *Introduction to Robotics*.  The purpose of any "Hello World" program has always been to demonstrate the ability to use a programming interface.  The roots of this activity go back to a programming book written in 1978 called [The C Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language).  You will use this assignment as a chance to set up our programming environment, run your code to the Arduino and submit your finished assignment here on GitHub.

For all programming assignments in this class you will do the following:
1. Read the README.md file provided in the assignment repository for instructions.
2. Copy any starter code provided for you (Starter.ino file) into the [Codebender IDE](https://edu.codebender.cc/class/1ajtp).
3. Modify the code according to the instructions for the assignmnet.
4. Test the code on your Arduino.
5. Debug code if necessary.
6. Create a new file in the assignment repository with the appropriate name.
7. Click the "Commit Changes" button at the bottom to submit.

Since this assignment is more about testing out your IDE and your ability to run code to the Arduino, this will be a simple assignment.  Specific instructions are listed Below:
1. Be sure to read this entire document before starting your work.  View the video below so you understand what you will be making.
2. Open the [Codebender IDE](https://edu.codebender.cc/class/1ajtp) which is a part of our school license.  There is also a free version of this but it has some limitations which will make it difficult to use for later assignments.
3. Go to the Starter.ino file in this repository.  Copy all of that code into the [Codebender IDE](https://edu.codebender.cc/class/1ajtp) fully replacing the code that is there.
4. Modify line 4 so that it will print "Hello World" when the program runs.  (Put that phrase in quotes inside the parenthesis after `Serial.println`.)
5. Test the code.  
    - Connect your Arduino to your computer with the blue USB cable.  
    - Select "Arduino Uno" in the first pulldown.  
    - Be sure that the second pulldown shows the current USB.  It should say something like ACMO?
6. Debug the code and repeat step 5 until it works.
7. Click the link above that says "Arduino_0.0-Hello_World".
8. Select "Add File" and then "Create New File".
9. Name the file Hello_World.ino.
10. Copy the code into the code window.
11. "Commit New File".
