# Arduino 0.0-Hello World
This is our initial programming assignment for *Introduction to Robotics*.  The purpose of any "Hello World" program has always been to demonstrate the ability to use a programming interface.  The roots of this activity go back to a programming book written in 1978 called [The C Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language).  You will use this assignment as a chance to set up our programming environment, run your code to the Arduino and submit your finished assignment here on GitHub.

For all programming assignments in this class you will do the following:
1. Read the README.md file provided in the assignment repository for instructions.
2. Copy any starter code provided for you (Starter.ino file) into the Arduino IDE.
3. Modify the code according to the instructions for the assignmnet.
4. Test the code on your Arduino.
5. Debug code if necessary.
6. Create a new file in the assignment repository with the appropriate name.
7. Click the "Commit Changes" button at the bottom to submit.
